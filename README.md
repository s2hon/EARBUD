# EARBUD
## Introduction
Other platforms have proven that users enjoy the ability to not just consume media, but to catalogue and review it as well.  This fact presents itself in the audience score for Rotten Tomatoes and the entire social book review site GoodReads.  But while movies and books are represented in this field, music is suspiciously absent.  EarBud seeks to fill this gap.

EarBud is a site that allows a user to search, catalogue, and review music on an individual page, curating their tastes and watching trends emerge in real time.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in the construction of EarBud:
* Node.js
* Express
* jQuery
* Foundation
* Spotify
* Ajax calls
* Sequelize 
* jawsDB
* MySQL
* .env

## Installation
When installing Earbud, an NPM should be run for the dependencies, a SQL db needs to be created, and a .env file needs to be created with individual login credentials.

## Usage
EarBud is designed for personal usage as an entertainment/social product, a way for users to create their own reviews to the music that speaks to them.  Or, conversely, to vent about music for which they have strong negative feelings.
